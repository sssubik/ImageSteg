Hi there,

This is a steganography project.
For Image:
	The UI consist of slot for Cover Image, Secret Image, Composite Image.

	First you load the Cover Image, Secret Image to respective slots and then convert it to Composite Image. Ihe secret image is embedded into cover image to form composite image.

	Then you save the composite image.

	Finally you again load the composite Image to the required slot and Alas you can get the Cover Image and Secret Image back.

Similarly  for text:

	You first need to type in the secret texts you want to hide  to text field

	Then convert the text to secret image

 	Finally follow the steps mentioned for Image.
Thanks
